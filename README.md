# QuickSign
A chrome extension to let you quickly sign up for websites using a temporary account

PLEASE NOTE: This extension uses plaintext password storage. Please do NOT use this as a password manager or use the accounts created through this extension for anything but a temporary period as this is incredibly insecure. This extension is made to facilitate the creation of temporary accounts for access to websites that require a login without forfeiting your personal email/password information, and NOT to ease in the creation of permanent or long-term website accounts. 

The creator of this extension is NOT responsible for any damages caused by penetration into the local storage of the extension used for malicious purposes.
